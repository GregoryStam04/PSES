Hi!

This repo consists of two projects for the class of Digital Signals Processing
at the 6th Semester of ECE NTUA.

It provides a brief and playfull understanding of concepts like signal recostruction, noise 
filtering and background noise removal, as well as notes detection.

The instructions given by the professor are written in Greek and are located 
at the Instructions folder, and some sample sounds in the Material folder.

Code is written in Jupiter Notebook, using Python libraries such as: 
	numpy 
	matplotlib
	soundfile
	IPython
	librosa
	scipy

I would also like to thank my partner in these projects, Vasileiadis Dimitris.
