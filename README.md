## Overview

This repository contains two projects for the Digital Signal Processing course (6th Semester, ECE NTUA). The projects demonstrate concepts such as:

- Signal reconstruction
- Noise filtering
- Background noise removal
- Notes detection

Sample sounds are provided in the `Material/` folder. Project instructions (in Greek) are in the `Instructions/` folder.

## Folder Structure

- `Project_Lab1_code/` — Jupyter Notebooks for Lab 1
- `Project_lab2_code/` — Jupyter Notebooks for Lab 2
- `Material/` — Sample sound files
- `Instructions/` — Project instructions (PDF, Greek)
- `Final Outputs/` — Output audio files
- `Reports/` — Project reports (PDF)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- soundfile
- IPython
- librosa
- scipy

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib soundfile ipython librosa scipy
```

### Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `Project_Lab1_code/` and `Project_lab2_code/` folders to explore the code and run the experiments.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
